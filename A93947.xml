            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I come here my Lords to pay my laſt debt to ſinne, which is death; and through the mercies of God, to riſe againe in eternall glory.</p>
            <p>My Lords, if I may uſe a few words, I ſhall take it as a great courteſie from you: I am come here my Lords, to ſubmit to the judgement that is paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I doe it with a very quiet and contented mind; I do freely forgive all the world, a forgivenes not from the teeth outwards (as they ſay) but from my heart; I ſpeak it in the preſence of Almighty God, before whom I ſtand, that there is not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing

            <p>One thing I deſire that I might be heard, and do hope that for Chriſtian charities ſake I ſhall bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved: That I was ſo farre from being againſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, that I alwaies did thinke Parliaments in England to be the happy conſtitutions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Nation, and the beſt meanes under God, to make the King and his people happy: As for my death I doe heere acquit all the world, and beſeech God to forgive them: In particular, I am very glad his Majeſty conceives me not meriting ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſhment, as the utmoſt execution of this ſentence, I doe infinitely rejoice in it, and in the mercy of his, and doe beſeech God to returne to him the ſame, that he may finde mercy when hee hath moſt need of it.

            <p>My Lo: I doe profeſſe my ſelfe ſeriouſly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and truly, to bee an obedient ſonne of the Church of England: in that Church I was borne and bred, in that Religion I have lived, and now in that I dye; proſperity and happineſſe be ever to i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then turning himſelfe about, hee ſaluted all the Noble men, and tooke a ſolemne leave of all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons on the Scaffold, giving them his hand:</p>
            <p>And after that hee ſaid, Gentlemen, I would ſay my praiers, and I intreat you all to pray with mee, and for me; then his Chaplaine laid the booke of Common praier upon the chaire before him as hee kneeled downe, on which he praied almoſt a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre, then hee praied as long or longer without a booke, and ended with the Lords praier; then ſtanding up he ſpies his brother Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> and calls him to him, and ſaith, brother we muſt part, remember me to my ſiſter, and to my wife, and carry my bleſſing to my eldeſt ſonne, and charge him from me, that hee feare God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue an obedient ſonne of the Church of England, and that he ſhould approve himſelfe a faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King, and tell him that he ſhould not have any private grudge or revenge towards any concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me, and bid him beware that he medle not with Church livings, for that will prove a moth &amp; canker to him in his eſtate, and wiſh him to content himſelf to be a ſervant to his country, as a Juſtice of peace in his County, and not aiming at higher preferments; carry my bleſſing alſo to my daughters <hi>Anne</hi> and
